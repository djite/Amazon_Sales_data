The explanation can be divided into 2 step:

1.	Step 1: Data cleansing

In this part I:

a.	Converted the "Date" column to the appropriate date format by creating a new Date column and deleting the old one.
b.	Removed unnecessary columns such as "index" and "Unnamed: 22
c.	Deleted rows with missing or null values, if any.
d.	Converted the "Amount" and "Qty" columns to the following format 
e.	Handled any inconsistent names or typing errors in columns.

2.	Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Now that the data is clean, I can proceed with exploratory analysis. The main objective is to understand the data and identify patterns or insights that can help improve business operations and sales performance.

To do this, I created 5 pages in the pbix to answer the questions:
	filter page : To filter all pages 
	Sales performance analysis
	Inventory management
	Order status analysis
	Promotions and discounts
